# Game Title

## Description
This is a simple game built for Arduino using Adafruit_GFX and Adafruit_ST7735 libraries. The game involves controlling a player character to avoid obstacles and collect items while maintaining the player's life.

## Features
- Player control using joystick and buttons.
- Collision detection with obstacles and items.
- Scoring system based on collected items.
- Health system with life decrement over time.
- Game over screen with score display and option to restart or exit.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Adafruit ST7735 TFT display
- Joystick module
- Buttons (left, right, start)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
3. Open the Arduino IDE.
4. Load the main game sketch (`game.ino`) into the IDE.
5. Make sure to install the required libraries: Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_ST7735, and Wire.
6. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
7. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Connect the Adafruit ST7735 TFT display, joystick module, and buttons to the Arduino board according to the wiring diagram provided.
2. Power on the Arduino board.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the menu and start the game.
4. Use the joystick to control the player character and avoid obstacles.
5. Collect items to increase your score and health.
6. Avoid collisions with obstacles to prevent losing health.
7. The game ends when the player's health reaches zero. You can choose to restart or exit the game from the game over screen.

## Wiring Diagram
Include a wiring diagram or a clear description of how to connect the components to the Arduino board.
